# MINI App

A simple webpage designed to emulate the experience of the MINI Canada auto manufacturer. Loads in car information from a database and displays it in card view with clickable cards.

## Installation
> Clone the repo to your local machine. This uses PHP on the back end, so you'll need something like WAMP or MAMP to run it (alternatively configure a Docker project and run it that way).

> Copy the repo to your www or htdocs folder

> Import the included database into phpmyadmin

## Usage
Navigate the page and try clicking on the car cards. Info loads in!

CSS is generated with SASS using the command line tools. You'll need dart-sass (preferred) - [you can get it here](https://sass-lang.com/install)
